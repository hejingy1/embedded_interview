Is a fairly simple program that will test the user cpu cache size by increasingly writing to an array, and record the time it take for each write up. Observing the time jumps you can tell the size of each L1 L2 L3 size. Another program do the same thing for memory. Please run the program by typing ./bandwidth into the terminal and check the text file it generate.
